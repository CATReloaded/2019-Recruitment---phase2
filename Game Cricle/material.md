## Game Circle
### 1. Finish the following tutorial (https://bit.ly/37mXGLu)
### 2. Search how to get both multi-line and space-separated inputs through console in C#

## Game Circle Task

###  Create a Base Class and Call it Enemy with 2 virtual methods 
###   1 { GetDamage() that prints the assigned damage to this type of Enemy to the console }, 
###   2 { GetType() that prints the Enemy's type to the console }
###      Create Another 2 Classes that inherit from Enemy and overrides the 2 virtual methods
###      for example create TankEnemy and MageEnemy inheriting from the Enemy class then override the 2 virtual methods
###      so when getDamage() is called from TankEnemy it returns 50 - for example -
###      or when getDamage() is called from MageEnemy it returns 100 - for example -
###      and GetType() would just print wither it's TankEnemy or MageEnemy.
